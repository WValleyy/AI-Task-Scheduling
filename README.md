- Philosopher : Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has his own plate at the table. There is a fork between each plate. The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two forks. Each philosopher can only alternately think and eat. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat his spaghetti when he has both a left and right fork. Thus two forks will only be available when his two nearest neighbors are thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, he will put down both forks. The problem is how to design a regimen (a concurrent algorithm) such that any philosopher will not starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think
- Solution : This solution imposes the restriction that a philosopher may pick up her chopsticks only if both of them are available. To code this solution, we need to distinguish among three states in which we may find a philosopher. For this purpose, we introduce the following data structure: enum {THINKING, HUNGRY, EATING};
- Input : 5 thread which is 5 philosopher at the begin state is thinking
- Output : the state of philosopher : in txt file
